nodes 1 and 18 are in the same square and are 4954 units apart
	But you can go outside of the square?

In a 10x10 	 grid, two nodes in the same square can be no further than about 14.1 	 units apart
In a 100x100	 grid, two nodes in the same square can be no further than about 141.4	 units apart
In a 1000x1000	 grid, two nodes in the same square can be no further than about 1414.2	 units apart
In a 10000x10000 grid, two nodes in the same square can be no further than about 14142.1 units apart

Assumption: The each square must be of size 1000x1000 on a 10x10 grid
Therefore, no two nodes can be further than 14142 units apart
Make sure you do not overestimate heuristic: i.e. safe to underestimate but do not overestimate
	If two nodes are in the same square:  Heuristic will give distance as 1
	If two nodes are in adjacent squares: Heuristic will give distance as 1
		If nodes share a row or column
	If two nodes are not in the same or adjacent squares: let's just say 1000 for now
		distance = max({|r1-r2|},{|c1-c2|}) * 1000


Maybe landmark is the square that the vertex is in?
